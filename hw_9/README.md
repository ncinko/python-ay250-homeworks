hw_9 README

The full solution is kept in the Jupyter notebook 'hw9_notebook.ipynb'.
If you don't want to spend the processing time running PyMC3's NUTS sampling algorithm, four pickled files are included in the repo.  
Rather than calling the modelData() function in the <b>Example in running the model</b> section of the notebook, just use the openTrace() function calls.
All answers are kept in markdown cells, along with a summary of results at the end.
